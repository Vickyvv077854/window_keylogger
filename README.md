# 🕵️ Telegram-Based Python Keylogger

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is strictly for **educational purposes only**. Do not use this on any device without the owner's consent. Unauthorized use is illegal.

This is a Python-based keylogger that logs all keystrokes and sends them to a Telegram bot every 60 seconds. It hides itself in the system, adds itself to Windows startup, and runs silently in the background.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Keystroke logging using `pynput`
- ✅ Sends logs to Telegram using a bot
- ✅ Auto-start on Windows boot using Registry
- ✅ Hides in `%APPDATA%`
- ✅ Lightweight and efficient

---

## 📜 How It Works

### 1. `pynput` is used to capture keyboard input.
### 2. `requests` sends the logs to your Telegram bot using the Bot API.
### 3. The script hides itself in `%APPDATA%` and creates a Windows Registry key for persistence.
### 4. It sends logs every 60 seconds using a timer thread.
